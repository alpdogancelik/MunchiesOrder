# TODO tracker

- [x] Guard Appwrite auth/data helpers so dev mode stops spamming the hosted endpoint.
- [x] Replace the restaurant console with the lightweight dashboard (no kitchen load/ritual clutter).
- [x] Rebuild the customer cart/order tab to match the shared mock.
- [x] Add the Pexels image search utility plus picker to the menu form.
- [x] Stabilise `useServerResource` consumers to prevent re-render loops and key warnings.
- [ ] Drop your real `EXPO_PUBLIC_PEXELS_API_KEY` into `app.json` (or `.env`) and reload Expo.
- [ ] Run on device/web and exercise auth -> restaurant -> cart once the new key is configured.
