You’ve had enough time and enough of my money. The app is still full of critical bugs and missing features. Fix these issues IMMEDIATELY and COMPLETELY:

---

 1. Courier Panel Bugs:
* Courier names and text overflow visually — fix the layout so nothing spills or looks broken.
* Logged-in couriers are NOT reflected in the restaurant’s “Assigned Couriers” list. Instead, dummy couriers show up.
* Ensure the restaurant owner sees real, active couriers that are authenticated and online, not placeholders.

---

 2. Chatbot (Support Widget):
* The support chatbot is NOT responsive on mobile — it’s stuck at the bottom and hidden. Fix its behavior to auto-adjust and remain visible in mobile viewports.

---

 3. Restaurant Owner Permissions:
* Restaurant owners STILL cannot:
  - Upload images properly when adding menu items
  - Edit their own restaurant info or profile
* Image uploading MUST support camera or gallery access — not just static .jpg URLs.
* Profile edit section is missing completely. Restore it.

---

 4. Authentication & User Roles:
* Restaurant authentication is broken — new restaurants cannot properly create or access their accounts.
* Each restaurant must be able to create a profile, log in, and manage their own menus, couriers, and info.
* Fix any routing, database, or auth guard issues causing this.

---

 5. Student Panel:
* Search and ordering are STILL broken. This is core functionality.
* Orders do not show progress or update state.
* “Place Order” button is unreliable.
* Fix all student-side bugs including order tracking, history, and cart state.

---

 6. Landing Page:
* Remove login from the public landing page — it’s not the place for it.
* Clean up the UI — it still looks too cluttered and inconsistent.

---

 7. Payments:
* iyzico integration is not working properly.
* Orders fail even after payment is submitted.
* Add “Cash on Delivery” and “Card on Delivery” options as promised. Make sure they’re functional and toggleable based on user input.
* Refund my payment test if functionality still fails.

---

 Summary:
* I’ve paid money and given specific feedback over and over, but major features are still broken.
* This is no longer acceptable — you must treat this like a real product and fix things properly from backend to frontend.

Deliver a clean, fully working version with:
* Courier/restaurant linking
* Real image upload
* Fully working order + payment flow
* Bug-free responsive UI

No more half-done patches. Fix it like it’s launching to real users.
